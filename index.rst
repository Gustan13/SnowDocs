SnowDocs documentation
======================

Welcome to the SnowSoup engine documentation, the free and open-source 3D Game Engine for Apple Devices (only MacOs at the moment).
If you're new to this webpage, head on to the Setup page to get started.
If you've been here before, enjoy!

This project is the culmination of six months of hard work and a life long passion for games.
The documentation is still a bit raw but will be thoroughly updated in the future.
