Setup
+++++

In order to start using SnowSoup, the first thing you need to do is download the static library file from the GitHub repository.
You then need to put the file in your Xcode project folder.
Next thing, on Xcode go to build settings in your project and add the path to the headers in "Header Search Path" and the path to the library in "Library Search Path". In build phases, add the framework file to "Link Binary with Libraries".

There! Now your Xcode is ready to use SnowSoup.
